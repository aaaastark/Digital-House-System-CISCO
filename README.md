# Digital-House-System-CISCO

The technology has been growing from day to day in human life. The
necessity for the development of technology is to lead human life
comfortably. The basic need of human to lead his/her life comfortably is
home. A home with updated latest technology which means a digital
house. One is needed to create a digital house when electronic devices
are switched on and off. Digital house development is achieved by
simulation via testing system, network setup and wireless home gatewa
computer network equipment required by a digital house network cisco
packet tracer using Internet Thing (IoT)/IoE command.

Including various smart objects which are used for implementing digital
house automation such as windows, fans, lights, doors, lawn sprinklers
web cams and various sensors etc. The Home Gateway via IOT server
are used for controlling the objects and sensors, which are providing
programming environment for controlling objects that are connected and
provide control mechanisms through the registration of Home Gateway
via IOT server (smart devices).

### Aim and Scope
• Living home that includes smart objects with specific functions is called smart home. I.e. aimed to improve safety, comfort and efficiency.

• Safe House System. The control every things of home using smart devices.

• IOT industry demandable thing.

### Limitations
• There are usually monitoring tools, and the devices that are controllable and automatic this can be accessed via an internet-connected

computer or smart mobile device.
